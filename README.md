1.Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/indian-weather-repository-daily-snapshot
This dataset provides real-time weather information for major cities in India. Unlike forecast data, this dataset offers a comprehensive set of features that reflect the current weather conditions.

2.About project: The ML model is used to predict the weather condition. The dataset having the 40+ features including temperature, wind, pressure, precipitation, humidity, visibility, and air quality measurements.

     #)Target column - 'condition_text' is the target column it contain some category like,
                        sunny,cloudy,clear,Light rain etc.
 Basically it is a multiclass classification model.  
 
3.Algorithms: The model is made by using random forest classifier algorithm with hyperparameter tunning.

     #Accuracy:
       Training data - 97%
       Test data - 94%
