1.Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/indian-weather-repository-daily-snapshot
This dataset provides real-time weather information for major cities in India. Unlike forecast data, this dataset offers a comprehensive set of features that reflect the current weather conditions.

2.About project: The ML model is used to predict the weather condition. The dataset having the 40+ features including temperature, wind, pressure, precipitation, humidity, visibility, and air quality measurements.

     #)Target column - 'condition_text' is the target column it contain some category like,
                        sunny,cloudy,clear,Light rain etc.
 Basically it is a multiclass classification model.  
 
3.Algorithms: The model is made by using random forest classifier algorithm with hyperparameter tunning.

     #Accuracy:
       Training data - 97%
       Test data - 94%

a) At high latitude weather condition is (Light freezing rain, patchy snow possible and patchy light snow with thunder) colder.

b) At low latitude weather condition is (Heavy rain at times, Torrential rain shower).

c) Reason is temperature become lower as we moving towards high latitude areas.

### 2) What is wind speed(kph) in different weather condition?.

a) Wind speed is maximum during 'Heavy rain'.

b) At heavy rain wind speed is 37 kph.

c) The average wind speed during heavy rain is 17 kph.

### 3) Weather condition on different temperatures?.

a) The visibility is almost good in majority of condition given on graph.

b) Except Fog , the visibility of fog is minimum i.e zero or near to zero.

### 5) How temperature changes according to the region in india?.
